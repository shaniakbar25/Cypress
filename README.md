📝 **About the Project**

This project uses Cypress for automation testing, integrated with Cucumber for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) support. Tests are structured using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to keep test logic separate from page interactions. This approach helps make tests easier to maintain and scales well for large applications.

🏗️**Project Structure**

- e2e: Contains feature files written in Gherkin syntax for defining test scenarios.
- fixtures: Holds static test data for reuse.
- pages: Contains POM classes representing each page, organizing element selectors and functions for page interactions.
- step_definitions: Contains the implementation of Gherkin steps using Cypress commands.

🚀 **Installation**

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shaniakbar25e/Cypress.git
Install dependencies:
npm install

▶️ **Running Tests**

To run tests in headless mode:
npx cypress run

To run tests in interactive mode:
npx cypress open

To run a specific feature file:
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/feature-name.feature"


📈 **Best Practices**

Modularize Step Definitions and Page Objects: Keep reusable logic in page object classes, while scenario-specific logic goes in step definitions.
Use Cypress Custom Commands: Add custom Cypress commands in commands.js for repeated actions like login, reducing redundancy.
Avoid Hardcoding Test Data: Use data from fixtures to ensure flexibility and ease of modification.
Keep Tests Independent: Write tests that don’t rely on each other, which makes them more reliable and easier to debug.
Assertion Best Practices: Use assertions to validate each step in your test flow, avoiding unnecessary waits.
